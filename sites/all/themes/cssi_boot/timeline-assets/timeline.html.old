As many of you already know, this annual meeting is organized to address two important aims of the IMAT program: (1) to provide NCI program staff a chance to interact directly with PIs and receive an update on progress to date with supported research and (2) to provide an opportunity for interactions and exchange of ideas among meeting participants. The latter aim serves as a critical opportunity to spark new project collaborations for either further improvement of supported technology platforms or to launch the development of entirely new technologies. The interactions are also an important opportunity for receiving critical feedback and guidance from a broad community, as well as for fostering dissemination of the exciting technologies emerging from IMAT-supported researchers.;xNLx;;xNLx;An important issue in general from the perspective of any investor is the need to engage end-users early and often, and so the meeting includes various mechanisms for facilitating that communication. Researchers from NCI’s intramural laboratories of the Center for Cancer Research will be in attendance and likely asking questions throughout the meeting, including the poster sessions. You are very much encouraged to engage them to understand their interests and needs. Also note there are collaborative funding opportunities for projects involving intramural researchers. Many of the IMAT-supported technologies are multidisciplinary endeavors, and as such your fellow supported investigators also represent important end-user perspectives that might be explored. The relatively long breaks between sessions are meant to allow for such interaction and dialog. Finally, discussion groups are being organized to encourage exploration of emerging areas for which new technology development should be focused. Beyond the several topics introduced by NCI program scientists for discussion, participants are very much encouraged to form additional discussion groups and consider inviting other meeting participants to join.;xNLx;;xNLx;There are more exciting active research projects in the IMAT portfolio than we could possibly allow sufficient speaking time for, so we will continue our practice of having short “Poster Highlight” talks for those investigators presenting particularly interesting posters relevant to each session. As these presentations are short, each of you are encouraged to seek additional details from the poster during one of the two poster sessions. In addition to the agenda and presentation abstracts, a list of resources and funding opportunities we thought might be of interest to participants are included toward the back of this program book.",
